## Design & Architecture

### Class Structure
Explain your classes and their responsibilities:

**Class 1: [ClassName]**
- Purpose: [What does this class do?]
- Key attributes: [List main instance variables]
- Key methods: [List main methods and their purposes]
- Why this design: [Why did you choose to create this class?]

**Class 2: [ClassName]**
- Purpose: [What does this class do?]
- Key attributes: [List main instance variables]
- Key methods: [List main methods and their purposes]
- Why this design: [Why did you choose to create this class?]
