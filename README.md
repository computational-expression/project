## Coding Requirements

**For complete details on all coding requirements, see `REQUIREMENTS.md`.**

The project requires:
- **Hardware projects:** Minimum 300 lines of code
- **Software-only projects:** Minimum 400 lines of code
- Minimum 2 classes with clear responsibilities
- At least 12 functions/methods total
- Error handling and edge case management
- Meaningful use of lists, dictionaries, and control flow
- A new hardware component OR new software concept
- Comprehensive docstrings and code documentation

---

## Version Control Requirements

### **Branch Strategy**
- **At least 2 separate branches** for feature development
- **Branch naming:** Use descriptive names
- **Main/Master branch:** Should remain stable; merges only via PR

### **Commit Messages**
- **Format:** Clear, descriptive messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `Add user authentication with password validation`
  - ✅ `Restructure get_answer function to reduce redundancy`
  - ❌ `finished`
  - ❌ `update`

### **Pull Requests**
- **Minimum 2 PRs:** Each PR should represent a logical feature or milestone
- **PR Descriptions:** Each PR must include:
  - Summary of changes
  - What problem it solves
  - How to test it
  - Any breaking changes or dependencies
  - Which assignment requirements it fulfills
- **Code Review:** Each PR must be reviewed and approved by a TL before merging

---

## Code Review Process (Week 15)

**For complete code review preparation details, see `CODE_REVIEW_PREP.md`.**

During your code reviews:
- TL will review your code and ask conceptual questions
- You'll explain design decisions and walk through key functions
- You may be asked to whiteboard algorithms or class diagrams
- Code must be cleaned, documented, and running without errors

**Prepare by:**
- Understanding every line you wrote
- Knowing why you made each design choice
- Testing all major features thoroughly
- Practicing explanations and whiteboarding

---

## Final Presentation (December 8)

### **Presentation Format**
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Audience:** Entire class
- **Components:** Overview + Live Demo

### **What to Include**

**Overview (2-3 minutes):**
- What problem does your application solve?
- What are the key features?
- What hardware or new concept did you incorporate?
- Key design decisions and why you made them

**Live Demo (2 minutes):**
- Show your program running
- Demonstrate 2-3 key features
- Show how it handles an edge case or error gracefully
- Run it start to finish without errors

**See `PRESENTATION_RUBRIC.md` for the complete assessment checklist.**

## Grading

**Total Points: 15**

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| **Working Code** | 7 points |
| **Report** | 0.5 point |
| **Git** (commits, PRs) | 0.5 point |
| **Code Review #1** | 2.5 points |
| **Code Review #2** | 2.5 points |
| **Final Presentation** | 2 points |

## Using Resources & LLMs

**You are encouraged to use online resources and LLMs (including GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help with your project.**

**However, there are important requirements:**

✅ **You must:**
- **Understand every line of code** you submit
- **Be able to explain** your code design and implementation
- **Be able to reproduce** any code you use (not just copy-paste)
- **Know why** you made each design choice
- **Be able to modify** your code if asked during code review

❌ **You cannot:**
- Submit code you do not understand
- Copy code without learning how it works
- Use AI-generated code that you cannot explain in code review
- Claim code is yours if you cannot discuss its implementation

**During code reviews**, you will be asked to explain your code and may be asked to:
- Trace through your functions with example inputs
- Whiteboard your algorithms
- Modify code on the fly
- Answer questions about design choices

If you cannot explain or reproduce your code, that is a red flag that you have not truly learned it.

**Bottom line:** Use resources to learn faster, but make sure the final code and understanding are genuinely yours.

## Tips for Success

### During Development
✅ Commit often with clear messages  
✅ Write docstrings as you code  
✅ Test edge cases early  
✅ Use meaningful variable names  
✅ Keep functions small and focused  

### Before Code Review
✅ Read all your code line-by-line  
✅ Understand why you made each design choice  
✅ Test with invalid inputs  
✅ Practice explaining your code  
✅ Be ready to whiteboard  

### During Code Review
✅ Listen to feedback carefully  
✅ Explain your thinking  
✅ Ask clarifying questions  
✅ Show code examples  
✅ Do not be defensive  

### Before Presentation
✅ Rehearse at least 3 times  
✅ Test your demo before class  
✅ Have backup plan if demo fails  
✅ Know your 2-3 key features  
✅ Practice handling questions
